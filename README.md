# Glove-vs-Word2vec-
This is My final project for Practical Data Mining course at Nile University

This is a global vectors representation of Arabic Text File. Also the text is represented in word to vec model and sentiment analysis is performed using Naive Bayes in sklearn and a neural network in Keras 

The results are not supposed to be good, but this is an implementation for the future
